`purge`: _Use with caution_ Completely purge Docker containers, networks, images, volumes, and cache

`lint`: Run eslint

`build`: Build development server without running the server

`start`: Start development server at port `3000`

`reload`: Stop development server and restart the server at port `3000`

`hard-reload`: Stop container, remove container, rebuild container, and start development server

`debug`: Start development server in debug mode

`test`: Start test server

`reload-test`: Reload test server

`hard-reload-test`: Stop container, remove container, rebuild container, and start test server -->

```

```
bugfix/short-description-of-bugfix
```

Example:

```
feature/create-home-route

```zsh
git commit -m "[create] homepage route" -m "Create homepage route located at path / to return, Hello World"
```

```zsh
git commit -m "[delete] test.js" -m "Broke up test.js into testAuth.js and testCheckout.js"
```

### Pull Requests

Upon completing the feature/bugfix of the corresponding branch create a pull request with a title and description.
